            <p>WWhat if we could predict how long a patient will stay in the hospital based on their surgery and department? </p>
            <p>By visualizing recovery times across departments and surgery types, this project uncovers patterns in patient outcomes, helping hospitals optimize care, allocate resources efficiently, and improve recovery experiences.</p>
            <p>Through data-driven insights, we can bridge the gap between medical procedures and patient recovery expectations.</p>
