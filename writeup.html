    <h1>1. What have you done so far?</h1>
    <p>
        We decided to make a simplified Sankey diagram for our prototype with only three layers: 
        Department → Approach → Outcome. We have split the diagram into 3 animated steps showing 
        each pathway a patient can take depending on these three steps. For interactivity, users 
        have the option to watch the entire animation branch out, or to click through each step 
        to see how each path splits. We have also included a tooltip that tells users what branch 
        they are looking at when they hover over a specific section.  
    </p>

    <h1>2. What will be the most challenging of your project to design and why?</h1>
    <p>
        For our final visualization we will have more than these three layers, but we wanted to 
        ensure our planned interactive features worked for the prototype first. In the future, 
        we plan to add a way for users to see different segments of the Sankey diagram in more 
        detail. The biggest challenge we face is integrating all of this detail in a way that is
        easy for our users to follow. The amount of branches in the Sankey diagram, when combined
        with the animation, makes a lot of visual noise for the viewer. We are exploring ways to
        provide visual clarity without sacrificing detail and understanding. We are thinking about
        addressing these challenges with a contextual paragraph and splitting up the diagram into
        multiple interactive visualizations.
